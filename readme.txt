Improvements 

- reset state to default values when navigating to the home page 
(maybe set up context for all the select boxes)

- figure out responsive styling for large amounts of questions

- on mobile, if questions make the page have to have a vertical scroller,
the background images do not adjust to this.

- if fewer questions it looks ugly
